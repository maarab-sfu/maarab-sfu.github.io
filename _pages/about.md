I am a researcher in computer vision and machine learning, specializing in robust and trustworthy multimedia forensics under AI-driven attacks. I received my PhD from the School of Computing Science at Simon Fraser University (SFU), where I defended my dissertation, “Robust Multimedia Forensics against AI Attacks,” in December 2025. During my PhD, I was a Research Assistant at the [Network and Multimedia Systems Lab (NMSL)](https://nmsl.cs.sfu.ca/index.php/Network_and_Multimedia_Systems_Lab_(NMSL)) under the supervision of [Dr. Mohamed Hefeeda](https://www2.cs.sfu.ca/~mhefeeda/).

My research focuses on designing trustworthy visual AI systems that remain reliable under adversarial manipulation, generative AI attacks, and real-world content editing. My current research interests include:

1. Trustworthy and Robust AI for Vision Systems

2. Multimedia Forensics and Content Authenticity

3. Generative AI Defense, Deepfake Detection, and Content Provenance

4. Image and Video Restoration under Adversarial Manipulation

5. Biometric Authentication and Presentation Attack Detection

6. Security, Privacy, and Reliability of Multimodal AI Systems

I received my M.Sc. degree in 2019, with a thesis entitled “Band and Quality Selection for Efficient Transmission of Hyperspectral Images”.
